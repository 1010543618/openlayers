# Enhancements and Additions

## Dotless identifiers

Previously, objects generated by the library were given id properties with values that contained dots (e.g. "OpenLayers.Control.Navigation_2").  These same identifiers are also used for DOM elements in some case.  Though uncommon, a developer may want to access these elements with a CSS selector.  To facilitate this, we now always generate ids with underscore instead of dot.

## Better support for analog scroll wheel

Removed rounding of zoom level for maps with fractionalZoom == true. So users with an OS and interface device with analog scroll support will now get smooth zooming.

## "chrome" added to OpenLayers.BROWSER_NAME

Chrome was incorrectly detected as "safari". Code that expect OpenLayers.BROWSER_NAME to be "safari" in Google Chrome will cause problems. Test for "chrome" as well, or use the new OpenLayers.IS_WEBKIT.
