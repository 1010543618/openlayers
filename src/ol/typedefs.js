 * for the Closure compiler. Originally they were included in the appropriate
 * namespace file, but with the move away from Closure namespaces and towards
 * self-contained standard modules are now all in this file.
 * Unlike the other type definitions - enums and constructor functions - they
 * are not code and so are not imported or exported. They are only referred to
 * in type-defining comments used by the Closure compiler, and so should not
 * appear in module code.

 * They are now all in the `ol` namespace.
